/**
 * This file is defines where the include directory for XRMS is, 
 * and sets the error reporting level.
 *
 * Ideally, your include directory will be outside of the web server document root.
 *
 * The include directory needs to have the trailing slash to the directory.
 *
 * If you are running the webserver in a chroot environment, the first 
 * slash in the include path will be relative to the chroot path.
 *
 * The error reporting level for XRMS is intentionally set to 
 * E_ALL and not E_NOTICE.  This should allow all real errors and warnings to 
 * show up without bothering us with notices about variables that are assumed to 
 * be inititalized to NULL values.
 * 
 * If you are debugging a really thorny problem, you may want to uncomment the second
 * error_reporting line and sort through the Notices.
