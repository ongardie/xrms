	* include/utils-interface.php:

	Sorry for the lack of comment on the css adds - meant to commit all of them
	together, and hit the wrong key.

	Anyway, the css additions are the new stylesheets, I should have some
	more samples after the holiday.

	The sheets are broken up into pieces:
	 All Media
	  layout.css - major content blocks
	  style.css  - basic fonts, table and form alignment, some padding

	 Print Media
	  print.css  - what makes it look pretty in the print preview

	 Screen Media
	  xrmsstyle.css - Additional font/margin/padding adjustments for the screen only
	  xrmsstyle-ie.css - Making it pretty in IE too

	 Alternate Style Sheets - Screen Media
	   (if you have Mozilla/Firefox, there are extensions to switch between them)

	 basic:
	  basic.css - Default Colors/backgrounds, etc. Should look familiar

	 basic-left:
	  basic-left.css - extension of basic.css with sidebar on the left side
	  basic-left-ie.css - make left sidebar look nice in IE, too.

	 I did not get everything done that I wanted today - fell down a rabbit hole playing
	 with fonts.

	 Left to do (if anyone wants to beat me to it, have a blast):

	  * Change pages with no Sidebar:
	        use ContentFullWidth instead of Content
	        remove empty Sidebar section
	     (Reports, Open Activities, New/Edit Case, New/Edit Note, Manage Category, etc.)

	  * Add additional class to "Activity" and "Search" tables that appear on
	    various forms so they don't print..
	        <div class="noprint">
	            <... Activity or Search table thing ..>
	        </div>

	  * Surround generated report information in a Report tag..
	        <div class="noprint">
	            <.. form for report input parameters ..>
	        </div>
	        <div id="generated_report">
	            <.. table containing report output ..>
	        </div>

	  * Change some of the admin forms (like New Role and New User) so that the
	    form is in the Content section, and not in the Sidebar. (In fact, you can
	    then remove the sidebar, as in the first bullet).

	Happy Holidays!

	Erin
