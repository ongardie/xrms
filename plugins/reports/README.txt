This plugin enables administrators to upload php files for custom reports.

WARNING: Using this plugin introduces a potential risk to the client's system because these scripts can be run as soon as they are uploaded.
Administrators should be certain the scripts will not damage Database or other files on the system BEFORE uploading them!

You must add a new directory/folder under /reports named custom and give it 755 or 777 rights before you can upload files using this plugin.
