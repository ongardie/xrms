1. What this and what it does
=============================

This is the serverinfo plugin for XRMS. As for what it does, perhaps it
is easier to explain the motivation for writing it. My company supplies
and maintains Linux-based Office Servers to small to medium sized
businesses; these servers handle email, store files, etc.  We needed a
way to track the details of these servers for support purposes - for
example, what IP address they are on, what services are enabled, what
domains they handle mail for, and so on. Thus was born the serverinfo
plugin, which allows us to associate one or more servers with a company,
and record details for each server.

2. Installation
===============

Untar the tarfile in the XRMS root directory, which will place all
extracted files in plugins/serverinfo:

$ cd YOUR-XRMS-INSTALLATION-DIRECTORY
$ tar zxf serverinfo-plugin-1.0.0.tgz

Installation requires the creation of three additional tables in the
XRMS database. To create them you will need to know your XRMS database
name, the username used to access the database, and the password used.
This information will be already defined in your includes/vars.php
file; in a future release of the serverinfo plugin this process could
be automated. Issue the following command, substituting the appropriate
values for the uppercase words:

$ cd plugins/serverinfo
$ mysql -u XRMS-USERNAME -p XRMS-DATABASE < serverinfo.sql

Enter the XRMS database user password when prompted.

Start XRMS and navigate to the Administration page, and then click on
"Plugin Administration". Tick in the checkbox next to "serverinfo" and
click Submit. If you get the message "plugin-cfg.php Config file can't
be opened. Please check vars.php." then ensure that
xrms-root/include/plugin-cfg.php is writable by your web server. Click
on the "Home" link and ensure that "Server information" appears in the
menu bar across the top of the screen.

3. Initial configuration and use
================================

By way of example, this section consists of a step-by-step guide to
defining the fields used to store server information, and the adding of
one server to a company. For each server we will store the server name,
its IP address, whether it is in a tower or rack case, whether it Dell,
HP or IBM system, whether it has 24hr support or not, and add a space
for notes. These items have been chosen to best show the features of
the serverinfo plugin.

1. Display the company details for any company, and note that at the
bottom of the right-hand sidebar there is a new section, "Server List",
containing only a "New" button. Click on the New button.

2. You will be prompted to enter the name of the server. For every
server, there is one required field which is used to identify the server
to the XRMS user. Before filling this field in, click on the "Edit
element definitions" button.

3. You will see that there is currently only one element defined, which
has a label of "Name". We will create a new element to store the
servers's IP address. Click on the "Add new element" button, which will
display a new line for us to define the "IP address" element.

4. Fill in the new line as follows:

 Label: IP address

 Leave the rest of the row as it is, and click "Save changes".

 The list of elements will now include one labelled "IP address"

5. Repeat the "Edit element definitions" and "Add new element", and
define the "Case" element as follows:

 Label: Case
 Type: radio
 Default value: rack
 Possible values: tower,rack

 ...and save changes. Add the remaining elements in the same way with
 the following values:

 Label: Supplier
 Type: combo
 Possible values: Dell,HP,IBM

 Label: 24hr support?
 Type: checkbox

 Label: Notes
 Type: textarea

6. You should now have a form with elements for Name, IP address, Case,
Supplier, 24hr support and Notes. Fill in some values and click "Save
Changes". You'll be returned to the Company Information page, but at the
foot of the right-hand sidebar you will see the name of the server you
have just defined. Clicking on the name will display the server details.

7. This is all very well, but it would be nice to have the "Notes"
details displayed beside, rather than beneath, the other details, and we
might like to have the "24hr support" field immediately under the server
name. Click on "Edit" then "Edit element definitions", and make the
follwoing changes:

 For the Notes element, change the "column" entry from 1 to 2
 In the "order" column, leave "Name" as 0, change "24hr support" to 1,
 and change all other values to "2". Click on Save Changes, and then
 Save Changes (again) from the next page. You'll see that the display
 has been changed.

8. You can define as many columns as you like, and they can be given any
name you like. Columns will be displayed in alphabetical order, so "8"
comes before "9", "10" comes before "2", and "middle" comes after
"first" and also after "last". Within in any one column the elements are
displayed in "order" order following the same rules as for columns.

9. Clicking on the "Server Information" link on the main menu will list
all servers for all companies.

4. Customisation
================

The file /plugins/serverinfo/serverinfo.inc facilitates some limited
customisation. The textural strings used to describe each type of
element ("text", "radio", "checkbox", etc) can be changed; the
representation of a cleared and checked checkbox can be changed, various
page headings can be changed, and finally the "Server Information" page
which lists all servers can be sorted by company name or server name.


5. Feedback, bugs, the future
=============================

I welcome all feedback on this plugin (like it? Tell me. Don't like it?
Tell me why), including suggestions, bug reports, patches, feature
requests, etc. Releases will be co-ordinated through the XRMS project.
