This plugin displays an ID photo on the top of the one contact sidebar.

Photos must be uploaded with the "New" button on the "Files" sidebar.

The file name that you enter
on the Attach File page MUST be id_photo_55 where 55 is the contact_id
that you want the photo attached to. The contact_id is listed in the
address bar of the one contact page. The actual file name of the image
does not matter.

Photos should be 120 pixels wide by 160 pixels high. If you want a
different size, change or remove "height=160 width=120" in setup.php

enjoy.
