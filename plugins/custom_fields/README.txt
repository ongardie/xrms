This is the custom_fields plugin for XRMS. The installation and configuration information
is contained in the /xrms/doc/users/XRMS_Administrator_Guide.pdf, Chapter 7
which should be read prior to installation.

DO NOT enable both the custom_fields plugin and its predecessor, the info plugin, on the
same installation of XRMS: it WILL break XRMS.
