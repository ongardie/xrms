XRMS Voice Mail Plugin v0.1
for use with the Asterisk Open Source PBX http://www.asterisk.org/

see voicemail-install.txt

The XRMS username is used to look up the correct extension in
/etc/asterisk/voicemail.conf If the XRMS username is not in voicemail.conf,
this plugin will not show any messages.  The *last* match is used.
This is a hack. Patches welcomed.
