1. What this and what it does
=============================

This is the info plugin for XRMS. It provides user-defined fields in certain
parts of XRMS (currently the company, contact and private sidebars, and within
company accounting and company content). For a practical application,  I will
explain the motivation for writing it. My company supplies and maintains Linux
servers for businesses, and we needed a way to track the details of these
servers for support purposes - for example, what IP address they are on, what
services are enabled, what domains they handle mail for, and so on. Thus was
born the info plugin, which allows us to associate one or more servers with a
company, and record details for each server. The plugin allows various "groups"
of information - for example, a "servers" section, an "ISP details" section and
an "Other Equipment" section.

2. Installation
===============

Installation requires the creation of three additional tables in the
XRMS database. To create them you will need to know your XRMS database
name, the username used to access the database, and the password used.
This information will be already defined in your includes/vars.php
file; in a future release of the info plugin this process could
be automated. Issue the following command, substituting the appropriate
values for the uppercase words:

$ cd YOUR-XRMS-DIRECTORY/plugins/info
$ mysql -u XRMS-USERNAME -p XRMS-DATABASE < info.sql

Enter the XRMS database user password when prompted.

Start XRMS and navigate to the Administration page, and then click on
"Plugin Administration". Tick in the checkbox next to "info" and
click Submit. If you get the message:

    "plugin-cfg.php Config file can't be opened. Please 
    check vars.php." 
    
then ensure that xrms-root/include/plugin-cfg.php is writable by your web
server.

3. Initial configuration and use
================================

By way of example, this section consists of a step-by-step guide to
defining the fields used to store server information, and the adding of
one server to a company. For each server we will store the server name,
its IP address, whether it is in a tower or rack case, whether it Dell,
HP or IBM system, whether it has 24hr support or not, and add a space
for notes. These items have been chosen to best show the features of
the info plugin.

1. Click on the "Administration" on the menu bar, and at the foot of the sidebar
click on "Manage Info Types".

2. Under "Add New Info Type" enter "Servers" and select that this information
should be displayed in Company Sidebar Bottom. Click Add.

3. Display the company details for any company, and note that at the
bottom of the right-hand sidebar there is a new section, "Servers",
containing only a "New" button. Click on the New button.

4. By default there is one "element" for each information section, and also by
default this is labelled "Name". You can change the label, but the existence of
one textual element is mandatory as this is how each each instance of this
section (ie, each particular server in this example) is displayed in the
sidebar. Enter a server name - eg, "Mail Server" - and click "Save Changes". The
Company Details page will display, and under the "Servers" section on the
sidebar you will see your server listed as a link. If you click on it you'll see
a display of all server information, although at this stage we have only defined
a name.

5. We will create a new element to store the servers's IP address. If you
haven't done so already, click on the server name to display its details. Click
on the "Edit" button, then the "Edit element definitions" button, and finally
the "Add new element" button, which will display a new line for us to define the
"IP address" element.

6. Fill in the new line as follows:

 Label: IP address

 Display in Sidebar: checked
 
 Leave the rest of the row as it is, and click "Save changes". By enabling
 "Display in Sidebar", the IP address will be visible without having to display
 all of the server's deatils.

 The list of elements will now include one labelled "IP address"

7. Click "Add new element" again and define the "Case" element as follows:

 Label: Case
 Type: radio buttons
 Default value: rack
 Possible values: tower,rack
 Display in Sidebar: unchecked

 ...and save changes. Add the remaining elements in the same way with
 the following values:

 Label: Supplier
 Type: combo
 Possible values: Dell,HP,IBM
 Display in Sidebar: unchecked

 Label: 24hr support?
 Type: checkbox
 Display in Sidebar: unchecked

 Label: Notes
 Type: textbox
 Display in Sidebar: unchecked

8. As mentioned above, the "Name" element is mandatory and thus its "Type",
"Display in Sidebar" and "Enabled" values cannot be changed. Click on "Back to
Item" at the foot of the page. This will display the server details, including
the new fields just added together with any default values those fields have.

9. Click on "Edit" and fill in or change values as required. When complete,
click on "Save Changes" and you should see all the server details displayed.

10. Click on "Back" to return to the Company Details page, and note that in the
sidebar under Servers the name of the server defined above is shown together
with its IP address (recall that we said the IP address should be displayed in
the sidebar). The rest of the server details may be seen by clicking on the
server name. Display those details now.

11. This is all very well, but it would be nice to have the "Notes"
details displayed beside, rather than beneath, the other details, and we
might like to have the "24hr support" field immediately under the server
name. Click on "Edit" then "Edit element definitions", and make the
following changes:

 For the Notes element, change the "column" entry from 1 to 2
 In the "order" column, leave "Name" as 0, change "24hr support" to 1,
 and change all other values to "2". Click on Save Changes, and then
 Back to Item on the next page. You'll see that the Notes are now displayed in a
 column on their own.
 
Click on Edit then Edit element definitions again, and change the order column
as follows:
 
 Name = 0, 24hr support = 1, all others = 2
 
Click on "Save changes" then "Back to Item", and notice now that the order of
the display has changed with Name first, 24hr support second, and the rest in no
specific order.

12. You can define as many columns as you like, and they can be given any
name you like. Columns will be displayed in alphabetical order, so "8"
comes before "9", "10" comes before "2", and "middle" comes after
"first" and also after "last". Within in any one column the elements are
displayed in "order" order following the same rules as for columns.

4. Customisation
================

The file /plugins/info/info.inc facilitates some limited
customisation. The textural strings used to describe each type of
element ("text", "radio", "checkbox", etc) can be changed; the
representation of a cleared and checked checkbox can be changed, various
page headings can be changed, and finally the "Server Information" page
which lists all servers can be sorted by company name or server name.


5. Feedback, bugs, the future
=============================

I welcome all feedback on this plugin (like it? Tell me. Don't like it?
Tell me why), including suggestions, bug reports, patches, feature
requests, etc. Releases will be co-ordinated through the XRMS project.
