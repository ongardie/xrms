   * Added code to HTML template to add the page's name, with WikiWords

     of nested selects.

     equals sign and after last equals sign.

2002-02-18  Scott Moonen  <smoonen@andstuff.org>

2002-02-15  Scott Moonen  <smoonen@andstuff.org>

   * Modified code so as to avoid generating warnings when PHP config
     variable error_reporting is cranked up to 15.  All of the immediately
     evident at-fault code has been fixed.

   * Relaxed rules for characters allowed in page anchors.
   * Fixed problems in configure.pl related to quotes in strings and files
     in DOS format.

     should allow browsers to implement persistent connections, thereby
     speeding up page loading.

   * Work around regex bug in PHP 4.03 that causes freelinks to render
     improperly.

     it to double-count some links.

     preferences.

     as SandBox, without linking to the given page.

2002-01-10  Scott Moonen  <smoonen@andstuff.org>

   * Added $SeparateLinkWords configurable to insert spaces in
     links to wiki pages.  Default is off.

   * Worked on streamlining installation, providing instructions for
     added security and ease of upgrade.
   * Introduced [[Transclude PageName]] macro, which will succeed
     the %%PageName%% syntax.  The double-% syntax is now deprecated
     and will be removed in 0.30.
   * Added action=style URL action to retrieve stylesheet.
   * Applied patch from David Baker to allow case-insensitive image
     suffixes, and also support .jpeg suffix.

     one level are allowed, but circular transclusions are disallowed.

     by refactoring the configuration scheme.

     macros.

     ((free links#anchor)).

2002-01-01  Scott Moonen  <smoonen@andstuff.org>

   * Change raw HTML processing to allow <html> tags to be uppercase.
   * Rework templates so parameters are passed as an associative array,
     rather than a hard-coded set of parameters.  This will allow for
     much more flexible extensibility.

2001-12-31  Scott Moonen  <smoonen@andstuff.org>

   * Fix rendering of {{ .. }} so that it slurps up braces within
     the outer braces.  I.e., {{{abc}}} now renders as <tt>{abc}</tt>.

   * Removed formatting markup to bring 'Tavi from XHTML-Transitional
     to XHTML-Strict.
   * Moved formatting information to 'template/wiki.css'.
   * 'Tavi now validates as XTHML-Strict and CSS compliant (except for
     wrap="virtual" attribute on text areas, which I don't think can
     be accomplished using CSS).

2001-12-19  Scott Moonen  <smoonen@andstuff.org>

   * Thoroughly rework list (indent, bullet, numbered) parsing.
     Engine output is now entirely XHTML-Transitional-compliant.
   * Add definition lists (syntax is ";term:definition").
   * Change $Unicode configuration option to $Charset configuration
     option, to allow engine to always emit a character set.

2001-12-18  Scott Moonen  <smoonen@andstuff.org>

   * Fix minor formatting glitches in the parse engine.
     Code now uses chr(255) to flag elements, rather than '\{n}'.

     the image's URL.

   * Implement table syntax in the rendering engine.

     arbitrary link text for free links.  Syntax is:
     ((page name|appears as this))
   * Fix parse_diff_message, which sometimes generated false matches
     for the diff pattern.
   * Fix html_time so that it returns 'never' for a timestamp that
     is empty (i.e., for an unedited page).
   * Remove 'document last modified' message from template/history.php,
     as the time was never passed to the history template.

2001-01-6  Scott Moonen  <smoonen@andstuff.org> 

   * Completed changes adding sisterwiki, interwiki, and remote_pages
     tables to the database schema. The first two define relationships
     with external wikis, which are now community-accessible through
     SisterWiki and InterWiki statement. The latter table is the list
     of known external pages.
   * Tweaked URL regex to handle a few extra terminating characters.

      whether to  create a persistent MySQL connection. Default is not
      to do so.

    * Version 0.04.

      was  rendered improperly (whenever the sub-page was itself a valid
      page name).
