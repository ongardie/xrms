This plugin integrates WebCalendar into XRMS.
It will use the same database as XRMS, but different tables.

Run install.sh to get v0.9.43 and copy the patched files.

Read the WebCalendar docs in src/docs/WebCalendar-UserManual.html
and src/docs/WebCalendar-SysAdmin.html

If you have any problems, please email me.

Enjoy.
