Please Note that this OWL plugin is not yet finished and should not be used at all!


This document is currently where I'm keeping my notes on the pieces left to be finished.



Search:
XRMS has certain search abilities such as searching on fields that are only stored in the XRMS files table.

OWL also has certain search capabilities such as searching the contents of files.

Since the search terms are always ANDed together, we can perform the two searches independantly and return the union of the sets.




Things to think about: 

	How will the files get downloaded

	What does files/one.php need added?




Table changes

ALTER TABLE files add external_id int default 0;

CREATE TABLE owl_folders (
               folder_id                                int primary key not null auto_increment,
               folder_name                              varchar(100),
               folder_description                       text,
               on_what_table                           varchar(100) not null default '',
               on_what_id                              int not null default 0,
               entered_at                              datetime,
               entered_by                              int not null default 0,
               file_record_status                      char(1) default 'a');
