README

This document is intended to describe the inner workings of the OWL
plugin to XRMS.


HISTORY

The OWL_API.php file which is the interface between OWL and XRMS was
developed with the assistance of Steve Bourgeois of the OWL project.
In order to have a usable plugin developed in a short time, the API
was kept simple and forces some constraints on the usage of XRMS and
OWL together.

DESIGN

At this time, manipulation of files and folders through the OWL 
interface once the XRMS OWL plugin has been enabled is not supported.

All files and folders added through XRMS are stored on the OWL side
as being owned by the 'xrms' user.  On the XRMS side, the files' and
folders' permissions are controlled by the ACL.

Each 'entity' in XRMS may have an entire virtual filesystem attached,
where an entity may be a company, activity, contact, or the 
private/home.php page.


For files displayed in /private/home.php, the document root of the 
filesystem within OWL is:

    /xrms/users/username/

For files attached to entities which follow the on_what_table/on_what_id
convention (companies, contacts, activities, etc.), the document root is:

    /xrms/on_what_table/on_what_id/

So files attached to company with company_id=23 would be found in

    /xrms/companies/23/

within OWL's directory structure.




As part of the installation procedure, XRMS creates a folders table, and
adds an 'external_id' column to the files table.  This field is used to
link the XRMS file record to the OWL's file table.  

Whenever a files sidebar is displayed, a 'current directory' is stored in
the session by storing the owl_parent_id.  This owl_parent_id refers to a
folder in OWL and is passed into the Browse function of the OWL_API.  When
browsing files attached to company with company_id=23, for example, the
session's owl_parent_id will be set to the folder record in OWL's folders
table that corresponds to the /xrms/companies/23/ folder.

Clicking on a folder in the sidebar therefore sets a new owl_parent_id in 
the session, which then gets passed to the OWL Browse function, which 
then returns the files which are found in that folder.






INSTALLATION

First install OWL.  Currently only the CVS version of owl-0.80 contains the
OWL_API.php file needed by the XRMS OWL plugin.  This version may be fetched
by issuing the command:

    cvs -z3 -d :pserver:anonymous@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/owl co -P owl-0.80

Note that you must set the location of AntiWord, pdf2text using the OWL admin
interface.

Also note that there is a Temp Directory used by OWL when indexing files that
must be set correctly for proper OWL operation.  

Then set $owl_location in plugins/owl/owl_plugin.php to reflect the location of 
OWL in the filesystem.

Next, enable the plugin in the XRMS Administrative interface.

Then, run the Database Structure Update in the Administrative interface.

If you fail to see any files listed, be sure to go into the Select Columns
function of the files sidebar, and ensure that you select the desired OWL
plugin fields, rather than the standard fields from XRMS.

XRMS Files are by default controlled by the ACL, and this includes files
within the OWL plugin.  If you do not see certain files, be sure that 
your user has permission to the files using the ACL tools.


USAGE

New XRMS functionality enabled by this plugin is described below.

Folders:
    
The files sidebar displays the 'current folder' in its caption (Files in:).
In actuality it is hiding the first 3 folders from the true path (e.g.
/xrms/users/user1).  The items in the Files in caption are links and provide
easy navigation upward in the case of a deeply nested folder structure.
"Add File" and "Add Folder" buttons should behave as expected.  The "Delete 
Folder" button will delete the current folder and all contents.  This is
a real delete, not a logical delete, you have been warned!

Versions:

After a file has been added, it is possible to update the file from the
files/one.php page.  The filename must not change, or an error will be
thrown from OWL.  If the file is uploaded again, a new version will be
created and both versions will appear in the pager at the bottom of the
files/one.php page.  Clicking on the older version will refresh the 
files/one.php page with the older version and therefore allow the older file 
to be downloaded.

Searching Contents of Files:

The OWL plugin uses a hook to add a "Search Contents of Files" field to 
the files/some.php search page.  OWL must be configured correctly for this
to work, particularly the locations of utilities such as antiword and pdf2text
which are used to build text indexes of binary files.  Consult the OWL 
installation instructions for more details.
