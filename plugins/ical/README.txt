iCal XRMS Plugin v0.1

This plugin exports activities in iCal format.

The iCal button shows on all views where activities are displayed.

Only activities that are displayed will export to the file.  We are
using this file to synchronize activities in MS Outlook 2007, and
on iCal on Mac.  We are then synchronizing from MS Outlook 2007 to 
Palm handhelds.

NOTE - this is a one-way sync to desktop.  There is currently no
reverse sync (upload) to the XRMS db.  This is being considered, but
is not part of this version.

enjoy.
