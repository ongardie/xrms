Single search box with usage of jquery.

Inspired on 1search by Glenn Powers.

This plugin ships jquery library in the directory js/jquery/ . You are able to modify colors by modifying js/jquery/jquery.autocomplete.css .

SETUP:

By default, you can search for contacts last_name, company_name and legal_name, opportunity_title, campaign_title and case_title. Search for contact first_names disabled by default, but you can enable it ( or even disable other searches) by modifying livesearch_jq.php. Look on top of the file and set fals to true or vice versa.
