What this plugin does/can do

1. It integrates XRMS into a 'contact us' page on your website
2. It creates activites for the actual email
3. It can create an opportunity based on the contents of the form (todo)

How to modify what it does

1. Examine the variables in new-form.php to get an idea of what you can customise on it.
2. Change the hidden variables in the contact.php form to change the default values for
        user_id
        crm_status_id
        industry_id
        session_user_id
        last_modified_by
