XRMS - README

---

SUMMARY

XRMS is a web-based application for managing business entities such as 
employees, customers, contacts, activities with those contacts, etc.

---

VERSION

0.9 -- December 2003

This version has had many many bug fixes and enhancements, but much of the code 
is still sloppy, some of it still doesn't work, and you probably still shouldn't 
trust it with anything important, as the data model may change substantially, 
and in some cases we may not feel like making future versions compatible with 
this one.

REQUIREMENTS

Currently, you'll need MySQL v4.0 and PHP v4.2 (or higher) for XRMS.

I like Red Hat machines, but XRMS should work just fine on Apple and Microsoft systems, too.  

---

INSTALLATION

1. Create a MySQL database to hold the XRMS tables, and pick a valid MySQL 
   account for XRMS to use.

2. Find the appropriate scripts in [xrms_root]/sql/mysql, and run them against 
   this database, in numeric order.

   Alternately, you may just 'source xrms-init-all.sql' which will source all the 
   other files.

   If you are upgrading from version .8b or similar, you will 'source upgrade.sql' instead   

3. Modify the file [xrms_root]/include/vars.php as appropriate for your company.  
   This is the primary XRMS configuration file. Make sure that your web server 
   has the appropriate permissions for the specified file storage directories.

4. Make a decision about where the XRMS "include" directory should go.  
   By default, it's at [xrms_root]/include, but this isn't very secure.  
   You should probably put it outside the document root of the web server, 
   but some of you won't have this option.  Either way, you'll need to modify 
   the [xrms_root]/include-locations.inc file as appropriate.

5. After building the database, putting the file directory where it should go, 
   and modifying the vars.php and include-locations.inc files, point your web 
   browser to the appropriate [xrms_root] directory.  If all has been 
   successful, you'll be able to log in using 'user1' and 'user1' for the 
   username and password.  Now would be a good time to change the 
   username/password for that account (go to Administration -> Users).

NOTES

1. For now, it's all in English, but translation capabilities are in progress.  
   If you can translate English business terms (like "customer" and "opportunity") 
   into other languages, please let me know.

2. There's almost no validation (client- or server-side) being performed yet, 
   so don't try anything funny.

3. Dates are expected to be in 'YYYY-MM-DD' format... the date-picker widget 
   should handle this automatically.

4. I never finished some mail-merge stuff, but the mail-merge functionality is now 
   available for preliminary testing and bug-fixing.

5. I'm still trying to figure out how best to include a flexible security layer 
   (roles, permissions, etc.) into XRMS, so for now, there's no ability to limit 
   what a logged-in user may do.  I've got some ideas for this, but it really is 
   difficult to make this both flexible and convenient.

6. To import companies, export a .csv file of companies (e.g., from Outlook) and 
   put the columns in this order:

   company_name - the name of each company
   company_phone - the primary telephone number for each company
   company_address - the primary address for each company
   company_city - the primary city address for each company
   company_state - the primary state/province address for each company
   company_postal_code - the primary postal_code for each company
   contact_first_names - the first name of the primary contact for each company
   contact_last_name - the last name of the primary contact for each company
   contact_phone - the phone number of the primary contact for each company
   contact_email - the e-mail address of the primary contact for each company

Then visit Administration -> Import Companies/Contacts, select the appopriate 
default values, and upload the file.

7. There's no documentation... until further notice, just use the forums at SourceForge 
   for support.  We'll be around to answer questions.

8. If you've got suggestions, please pass them along!

HINTS, installation on Windows
========================

While editing the above mentioned php files you will have 
to change the path name to XRMS.
Please enter the path name with slashes "/" (NOT 
backslashes "\", as commonly used in windows),
e.g. "C:/Program Files/Apache 
Group/Apache/htdocs/xrms"

HINTS, preventing some common errors 
==============================
To prevent to get too many php warning messages you 
might want to modify your php.ini as follows:
; - Show all errors, except for notices
error_reporting = E_ALL & ~E_NOTICE

If you get errors like "Warning: Cannot modify header 
information -.. " the set following option in your php.ini:
output_buffering = On
