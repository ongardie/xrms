XRMS CRM - README

=============================================================
/** $Id: README,v 1.24 2006/04/26 21:16:34 braverock Exp $ **/

========================
SUMMARY

XRMS CRM is a web-based application for managing business entities such as
employees, customers, contacts, activities with those contacts, etc.

XRMS generally falls into the category of application known as Customer
Relationship Management (CRM), Sales Force Automation (SFA), with aspects
of Business Intelligence (BI).  Basically, if your company needs to manage
relationships with your customers and business partners, XRMS should be able
to fulfill your needs. We believe XRMS is the only open source CRM
application with full Computer Telephony Integration (CTI) interfaces.

We believe that XRMS is the most advanced open source CRM application
written in PHP.  We hope that you will find it useful.

XRMS is a community-driven and supported development effort.  Companies that
are using XRMS contribute money and developer time to improve the system.

========================
VERSION

1.99.1 (v2.0rc2) 2006-04-26

We released XRMS v1.99.0 two weeks ago on 2006-04-11.
The response from the community has been outstanding.
We recommend that all users upgrade to the newest version.
This version makes a number of minor enhancements and bug fixes over version 1.99.0.
One fairly narrow bug bug has been corrected in v1.99.0 in the Contacts API layer
could have resulted in overwriting an existing contact with new data in a limited
set of circumstances. v1.99.1 also implements full new and edit support for the
centralized API functions in Contacts, Companies, and Addresses.
A number of XRMS's dedicated translators have helped us find unlocalized strings
and get those resolved in current code.
We have also made a number of user interface usability improvements in Companies
and Contacts. The speed of execution of Companies and Contacts has been improved
by the implementation of the API functions, which are more efficient than the old
non-API code in most cases.
This should result in more stable and predictable code for developers integrating to XRMS.

As always, we recommend that if more than a week or two has passed since the date on a stable release
tarball that you consider downloading and installing a development snapshot
instead.  These are normally quite stable, as the development team is probably
using that code in production at their respective companies.

========================
REQUIREMENTS

PHP v4.3.0 or higher with database extensions for your database.
PHP v4.2 or higher with the PEAR PHP_Compat package should also work.

A web server that supports PHP.
XRMS has been extensively deployed on Apache and IIS.

PHP should be compiled with gettext and recode support if you need
i18n/internationalization/translation.

We are officially stating that XRMS should now work with any database supported
by ADOdb.  ADOdb is an excellent free software database abstraction layer for PHP.
David Rogers did most of the heavy lifting to convert XRMS to truly be
multi-database compliant, and the rest of the development team is very grateful
for David's hard work.  At this point, any database supported by
ADOdb version 4.22 *should* work seamlessly with XRMS.  To the best of our
knowledge, XRMS has been successfully deployed on MySQL, MS SQL Server,
and SAP-DB/MaxDB.  It should work on Oracle and DB/2 as well.
The XRMS development team is currently collaborating with Kenny Holden
to provide support for PostgreSQL >= v8.1.
If you encounter problems or would like to tweak things to
work better with some other database, please let the development team know,
and we will be happy to work with you to get your issue resolved.

See include/adodb/docs/docs-adodb.htm#drivers for more information on the
databases supported by ADOdb.

If you are using MySQL, XRMS strongly recommends MySQL v 4.x+ for better
compatibility with the ADOdb Concat and Cast operators.  ADOdb attempts to mirror
this functionality in older MySQL installations, so you can try things without
upgrading MySQL first, but be aware that you may need to upgrade to a newer
MySQL version to get everything running.

XRMS is reported to work well under several Linux/Unix flavors, Mac OSX, and Windows Servers.

XRMS is regularly tested with most modern browsers, please report any problems.

========================
INSTALLATION

See the file INSTALL in the install/ directory.

========================
IMPORTING YOUR DATA

To import companies, export a .csv file of companies and contacts.
We've included templates for many common CRM/SFA applications, such as
Microsoft Outlook, Act!, SalesForce.com, Goldmine, Intuit Quickbooks,
and a 'default' import template.

Then visit Administration -> Import Companies/Contacts, select the appropriate
default values, and upload the file.  You will be able to preview the upload before
you actually commit to loading everything into the database.

We've tried to make the import 'safe'.
The import scripts run multiple checks on each record and attempts to not overwrite
existing data, or create duplicate records.  We make broad allowances for missing
data fields: as long as you have a Company Name (and a City for addresses),
things should work.

The default template includes the following fields:
    //company info
    company_name
    legal_name
    division_name
    website
    tax_id
    extref1
    extref2
    extref3
    company_custom1
    company_custom2
    company_custom3
    company_custom4
    employees
    revenue
    credit_limit
    terms
    company_profile
    company_code
    phone
    phone2
    fax

    //contact info
    first_name
    last_name
    email
    work_phone
    home_phone
    fax
    division
    salutation
    date_of_birth
    summary
    title
    description
    cell_phone
    aol
    yahoo
    msn
    interests
    contact_custom1
    contact_custom2
    contact_custom3
    contact_custom4
    contact_profile
    gender

    //address info
    address_name
    line1
    line2
    city
    state
    postal_code
    country
    address_body
    use_pretty_address

If you wish to use the default template, name the columns in your .csv
file as the columns are named above.  Don't worry if your file doesn't
have all the columns, or if the columns are in a different order.
The import routine uses the column names to determine which fields to
map things to, but it doesn't assume 'perfect data'.  Company name
is required.  If you want to import an address, City is required.
All other data will be handled safely if it is missing (we think).

You may also create your own templates, and submit them for
inclusion with XRMS.

If you create an import template for a third party CRM or contact
management application, or if you need help creating a template,
please contact the development team so that we may assist you and
so that we may include the new template in the next release.

A copy of this license -- called LICENSE -- is in this folder.

XRMS also includes code that is licensed under the GNU General Public
License (GPL) and GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL).
For full details see the file COPYING in this folder.

Whether the Open Software License and the GPL are fully 'compatible' licenses
in legal terms is an issue for a lawyer, not the development team of XRMS.
When in doubt, it is the intention of the development team that the more
'open' of the two licenses should apply.

Plugins that use the plugin architecture of XRMS may have any licensing
status that the authors of the plugin wish.  XRMS plugins do not need to
be distributed, at the sole discretion of the author.  XRMS Plugins that are
distributed may be distributed under any license, and will not be restricted
to the Open Software License or the GPL.  The development team certainly
wishes to encourage plugins to be distributed under an 'open source' or
'free software' license, and any plugin distributed with XRMS must be
under one of the licenses used by XRMS code.

========================
CREDITS

XRMS includes, and makes extensive use of, John Lim's excellent ADOdb
database abstraction library.
http://php.weblogs.com/adodb/

XRMS makes extensive use of code from Squirrelmail for the plugin architecture,
i18n/translation/localization, and a variety of utility functions.
http://www.squirrelmail.org/

The calendar widget is the excellent Dynarch DTML Calendar jscalendar-0.9.6
http://dynarch.com/mishoo/calendar.epl

We also currently use Aditus Consulting's JPGraph classes in some reports.
http://www.aditus.nu/jpgraph/index.php

Some pages currently make use of the PEAR HTML_QuickForm classes.
These may be downloaded from http://pear.php.net/package/HTML_QuickForm or by
simply entering 'pear install HTML_QuickForm' on the command line, if you have
PEAR installed. If you don't have PEAR installed, you may have errors
on PEAR.php.

XRMS was originally written by Chris Woofter, and is now maintained
and extended by a dedicated community of developers and translators
from companies around the world. See "XRMS Development Team" below.
========================
NOTES

1. We are still adding validation on form submits, and have a long way to go here,
   so don't try anything funny.

2. Documentation is still improving  We are happily accepting contributions of user
   documentation. Until further notice, just use the forums at SourceForge
   or #xrms on irc.feenode.net for support.  We'll be around to answer questions.

3. If you've got suggestions, please pass them along!

========================
CONTRIBUTING to XRMS

Many people have asked how they may contribute code back to XRMS.
We'll try to address most of those questions here.

If you wish to contribute documentation to XRMS, please contact
a member of the development team or post to the SourceForge Forums.

If you wish to contribute code to XRMS, you should be working from
the most current code possible.  In the case of bug fixes, this may
save you some work (someone else may have fixed it already), and in the
case of enhancements or other more complex patches, it will save work
for the developers by making very clear what has changed. For large,
sweeping changes, you probably want to discuss your proposed change on
the SourceForge Forums or the irc channel, so that the development team
and the XRMS user community can comment on your proposed changes.

If you want to integrate third party software to XRMS, you should probably
familiarize yourself with the Plugin architecture, as that is what plugins
are for.  If you find yourself needing more plugin hooks as you develop your
plugin, let the development team know by posting to the Plugins Forum
on SourceForge.  Somebody there will be happy to help you.

Start with a clean checkout from CVS or with a release tarball or snapshot.
The rest of these instructions will assume that you are working from a
snapshot tarball, which uncompresses to a directory called xrms.devel.
Change as required for your installation.

Update your installation from CVS using the following command from the
directory above your working directory:

cvs -q -z3 -d :pserver:anonymous@cvs.sf.net:/cvsroot/xrms update -d xrms

You will see cvs 'P' - Patch, 'U' Update, and 'M' Merge your files
(vars.php, plugin-cfg.php, and include-locations.inc will most likely 'M' merge)

'C' denotes a conflict.  You will need to examine the file with a conflict
and resolve any problems.  If you anticipate conflicts (e.g. it has been weeks
since you did a cvs update), you should probably call cvs with the -n flag,
which will just report on what will happen when you actually update, so that
you will be warned of conflicts in advance.

Make the changes you need to current CVS code.  Make a 'clean' copy of the
files you intend to modify, you'll need it later for creating the patch.

*** Do frequent CVS updates. ***

We recommend doing a CVS update before each development session.
This makes life easier for everybody.
Always do a CVS update immediately before submitting patch files, and
resolve and test any conflicts.

Once you've made your changes and are happy with the result, create a
patch file for each file you changed using the following command:

diff -u3 origfile changedfile >> filename.patch

the -u3 parameter to diff is very important, because it creates a 'unified'
diff with several lines of context.  This allows the patch program to find
where to insert the changed lines, even if the file has changed slightly
since the patch was generated.

Post your patch with a description of the changes to the SourceForge
Patches Forum.  It often helps to submit both a patch file and a copy
of the full,modified file.

One of the XRMS developers will review it and commit your changes to CVS.

Contributions made by you will be placed under Copyright by the
"XRMS Development Team", unless you indicate differently.

Thanks for your interest in contributing to XRMS!

========================
HINTS

Installation on Windows

While editing the above mentioned php files you will have
to change the path name to XRMS.
Please enter the path name with slashes "/" (NOT
backslashes "\", as commonly used in windows),
e.g. "C:/Program Files/Apache Group/Apache/htdocs/xrms"

Preventing some common errors
To prevent getting too many php warning messages you
might want to modify your php.ini as follows:
; - Show all errors, except for notices
error_reporting = E_ALL & ~E_NOTICE

If you get errors like "Warning: Cannot modify header
information -.. " then set the following option in your php.ini:
output_buffering = On
Note that turning on output buffering if you don't need it can cause
all sorts of problems, so leave it off unless absolutely necessary.

=======
HINTS, daily reports

To have daily reports emailed, put one or more of the following lines into
the crontab of your web server (adjust paths as necessary):

To have a daily report of ALL users open items emailed:
0 6 * * * (cd /var/www/html/xrms/reports; /usr/bin/php ./open-items.php "&send_email=y&type=all&send_email_to=USER@DOMAIN.COMt&all_users=y" >> /dev/null)

To have a daily report of a single user's open items emailed:
0 6 * * * (cd /var/www/html/xrms/reports; /usr/bin/php ./open-items.php "&send_email=y&type=all&user_id=1" >> /dev/null)

To have a daily report of ALL users completed items report emailed:
0 23 * * * (cd /var/www/html/xrms/reports; /usr/bin/php ./completed-items.php "&send_email=y&type=all&send_email_to=USER@DOMAIN.COM&all_users=y" >> /dev/null)

To have a daily report of a single user's completed items report emailed:
0 23 * * * (cd /var/www/html/xrms/reports; /usr/bin/php ./completed-items.php "&send_email=y&type=all&user_id=1" >> /dev/null)
