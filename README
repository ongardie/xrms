SUMMARY

XRMS is a web-based application for managing business entities such as 
employees, customers, contacts, activities with those contacts, etc.

---

VERSION

0.9 -- December 2003

This version has had many many bug fixes and enhancements, but much of the code 
is still sloppy, some of it still doesn't work, and you probably still shouldn't 
trust it with anything important, as the data model may change substantially, 
and in some cases we may not feel like making future versions compatible with 
this one.

CREDITS

XRMS includes, and makes extensive use of, John Lim's excellent ADOdb database abstraction library.
http://php.weblogs.com/adodb/

We also currently use Netscape's Javascript Graph Builder (written by Michael Bostock) for some reports.

The date-picker widget is from SoftComplex -- it's their Tigra Calendar.

REQUIREMENTS

Currently, you'll need MySQL v 3.23 (v4.0 recommended) and PHP v4.2 (or higher) for XRMS.

I like Red Hat machines, but XRMS should work just fine on Apple and Microsoft systems, too.

INSTALLATION

See the file INSTALL in the install/ directory.

NOTES

1. For now, it's all in English, but translation capabilities are in progress.  
   If you can translate English business terms (like "customer" and "opportunity") 
   into other languages, please let us know.

2. We are still adding validation on form submits, and have a long way to go here,
   so don't try anything funny.

3. Dates are expected to be in 'YYYY-MM-DD' format... the date-picker widget 
   should handle this automatically.

4. I never finished some mail-merge stuff, but the mail-merge functionality is now 
   available for preliminary testing and bug-fixing.

5. I'm still trying to figure out how best to include a flexible security layer 
   (roles, permissions, etc.) into XRMS, so for now, there's only limited ability 
   to limit what a logged-in user may do.  We've got some ideas for this, but it 
   really is difficult to make this both flexible and convenient.  

6. To import companies, export a .csv file of companies (e.g., from Outlook) and 
   label the columns with the names of the database columns:

   company_name - the name of each company
   company_phone - the primary telephone number for each company
   company_address - the primary address for each company
   company_city - the primary city address for each company
   company_state - the primary state/province address for each company
   company_postal_code - the primary postal_code for each company
   contact_first_names - the first name of the primary contact for each company
   contact_last_name - the last name of the primary contact for each company
   contact_phone - the phone number of the primary contact for each company
   contact_email - the e-mail address of the primary contact for each company

   Then visit Administration -> Import Companies/Contacts, select the appopriate 
   default values, and upload the file.  You will be able to preview the upload before 
   you actualy commit to loading everything into the database.  
   We've tried to make the import 

7. There's very little documentation.  We aer happily accepting contributions of user 
   documentation. Until further notice, just use the forums at SourceForge 
   for support.  We'll be around to answer questions.

8. If you've got suggestions, please pass them along!

HINTS, installation on Windows
========================

While editing the above mentioned php files you will have 
to change the path name to XRMS.
Please enter the path name with slashes "/" (NOT 
backslashes "\", as commonly used in windows),
e.g. "C:/Program Files/Apache 
Group/Apache/htdocs/xrms"

HINTS, preventing some common errors 
==============================
To prevent to get too many php warning messages you 
might want to modify your php.ini as follows:
; - Show all errors, except for notices
error_reporting = E_ALL & ~E_NOTICE

If you get errors like "Warning: Cannot modify header 
information -.. " the set following option in your php.ini:
output_buffering = On
