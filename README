REQUIREMENTS

Currently, you'll need MySQL v 3.23 (v4.0 recommended) and PHP v4.2 (or higher) for XRMS.
XRMS should work without modification on SAPDB/MaxDB if you need a really huge installation

XRMS is reported to work well under several Linux/Unix flavors, Mac OSX, and Windows Servers.

XRMS is regularly tested with most modern browsers, please report any problems.

INSTALLATION

See the file INSTALL in the install/ directory.

---
IMPORTING YOUR DATA
To import companies, export a .csv file of companies and contacts.
We've included templates for many common CRM/SFA applications, such as
Microsoft Outlook, Act!, SalesForce.com, and Goldmine, as well as a 'default'
import template.

Then visit Administration -> Import Companies/Contacts, select the appopriate
default values, and upload the file.  You will be able to preview the upload before
you actualy commit to loading everything into the database.

We've tried to make the import 'safe'.
The import scripts run multiple checks on each record and attempt to not overwrite
existing data, or create duplicate records.  We make broad allowances for missing
data fields: as long as you have a Company Name, things should work.

The default template includes the following fields:
    //company info
    company_name
    legal_name
    division_name
    website
    tax_id
    extref1
    extref2
    extref3
    company_custom1
    company_custom2
    company_custom3
    company_custom4
    employees
    revenue
    credit_limit
    terms
    company_profile
    company_code
    phone
    phone2
    fax

    //contact info
    first_name
    last_name
    email
    work_phone
    home_phone
    fax
    division
    salutation
    date_of_birth
    summary
    title
    description
    cell_phone
    aol
    yahoo
    msn
    interests
    contact_custom1
    contact_custom2
    contact_custom3
    contact_custom4
    contact_profile

    //address info
    address_name
    line1
    line2
    city
    state
    postal_code
    country
    address_body
    use_pretty_address

If you wish to use the default template, name the columns in your .csv
file as the columns are named above.

You may also create your own templates, and submit them for inclusion with XRMS.

NOTES

1. For now, it's all in English, but translation capabilities are in progress.
   If you can translate English business terms (like "customer" and "opportunity")
   into other languages, please let us know.

2. We are still adding validation on form submits, and have a long way to go here,
   so don't try anything funny.

3. Dates are expected to be in 'YYYY-MM-DD' format... the date-picker widget
   should handle this automatically.

4. I never finished some mail-merge stuff, but the mail-merge functionality is now
   available for preliminary testing and bug-fixing.

5. I'm still trying to figure out how best to include a flexible security layer
   (roles, permissions, etc.) into XRMS, so for now, there's only limited ability
   to limit what a logged-in user may do.  We've got some ideas for this, but it
   really is difficult to make this both flexible and convenient.

6. There's very little documentation.  We are happily accepting contributions of user
   documentation. Until further notice, just use the forums at SourceForge
   for support.  We'll be around to answer questions.

7. If you've got suggestions, please pass them along!

HINTS, installation on Windows
========================

While editing the above mentioned php files you will have
to change the path name to XRMS.
Please enter the path name with slashes "/" (NOT
backslashes "\", as commonly used in windows),
e.g. "C:/Program Files/Apache
Group/Apache/htdocs/xrms"

HINTS, preventing some common errors
==============================
To prevent to get too many php warning messages you
might want to modify your php.ini as follows:
; - Show all errors, except for notices
error_reporting = E_ALL & ~E_NOTICE

If you get errors like "Warning: Cannot modify header
information -.. " the set the following option in your php.ini:
output_buffering = On

HINTS, daily reports
==============================
To have daily reports emailed, put one or more of the following lines into
the crontab of your web server (adjust paths as nessecary):
