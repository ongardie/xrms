SUMMARY

XRMS is a web-based application for managing business entities such as
employees, customers, contacts, activities with those contacts, etc.

========================

This version has had many many bug fixes and enhancements.  We have also
added an automated installation, update, and data integrity process. See
the file install/INSTALL for details.

========================
REQUIREMENTS

Currently, you'll need MySQL v 3.23 (v4.x recommended) and PHP v4.2 (or higher) for XRMS.
XRMS is being ported to PostgresSQL, stay tuned to the Forums for more information.
XRMS should work without modification on SAPDB/MaxDB if you need a really huge installation.

XRMS is reported to work well under several Linux/Unix flavors, Mac OSX, and Windows Servers.

XRMS is regularly tested with most modern browsers, please report any problems.

========================
INSTALLATION

See the file INSTALL in the install/ directory.

========================
IMPORTING YOUR DATA

To import companies, export a .csv file of companies and contacts.
We've included templates for many common CRM/SFA applications, such as
Microsoft Outlook, Act!, SalesForce.com, and Goldmine, as well as a 'default'
import template.

Then visit Administration -> Import Companies/Contacts, select the appopriate
default values, and upload the file.  You will be able to preview the upload before
you actualy commit to loading everything into the database.

We've tried to make the import 'safe'.
The import scripts run multiple checks on each record and attempts to not overwrite
existing data, or create duplicate records.  We make broad allowances for missing
data fields: as long as you have a Company Name (and a City for addresses),
things should work.

The default template includes the following fields:
    //company info
    company_name
    legal_name
    division_name
    website
    tax_id
    extref1
    extref2
    extref3
    company_custom1
    company_custom2
    company_custom3
    company_custom4
    employees
    revenue
    credit_limit
    terms
    company_profile
    company_code
    phone
    phone2
    fax

    //contact info
    first_name
    last_name
    email
    work_phone
    home_phone
    fax
    division
    salutation
    date_of_birth
    summary
    title
    description
    cell_phone
    aol
    yahoo
    msn
    interests
    contact_custom1
    contact_custom2
    contact_custom3
    contact_custom4
    contact_profile
    gender

    //address info
    address_name
    line1
    line2
    city
    state
    postal_code
    country
    address_body
    use_pretty_address

If you wish to use the default template, name the columns in your .csv
file as the columns are named above.  Don't worry if your file doesn't
have all the columns, or if the columns are in a different order.
The import routine uses the column names to determine which fields to
map things to, but it doesn't assume 'perfect data'.  Company name
is required.  If you want to import an address, City is required.
All other data will be handled safely if it is missing (we think).

You may also create your own templates, and submit them for
inclusion with XRMS.

If you create a template for a third party CRM or contact management
application, or if you need help creating a template, please contact
the development team so that we may assist you and so that we may
include the new template in the next release.

CREDITS

XRMS includes, and makes extensive use of, John Lim's excellent ADOdb database abstraction library.

We also currently use Netscape's Javascript Graph Builder (written by Michael Bostock) for some reports.

The date-picker widget is from SoftComplex -- it's their Tigra Calendar.

========================
NOTES

1. For now, it's all in English, but translation capabilities are in progress.
   If you can translate English business terms (like "customer" and "opportunity")
   into other languages, please let us know.

2. We are still adding validation on form submits, and have a long way to go here,
   so don't try anything funny.

3. Dates are expected to be in 'YYYY-MM-DD' format... the date-picker widget
   should handle this automatically.

4. We never finished some mail-merge stuff, but the mail-merge functionality is now
   available for preliminary testing and bug-fixing.

5. We're still trying to figure out how best to include a flexible security layer
   (roles, permissions, etc.) into XRMS, so for now, there's only limited ability
   to limit what a logged-in user may do.  We've got some ideas for this, but it
   really is difficult to make this both flexible and convenient.

6. There's very little documentation.  We are happily accepting contributions of user
   documentation. Until further notice, just use the forums at SourceForge
   for support.  We'll be around to answer questions.

7. If you've got suggestions, please pass them along!

========================
CONTRIBUTING to XRMS

Many people have asked how they may contribute code back to XRMS.
We'll try to address most of those questions here.

If you wish to contribute documentation to XRMS, please contact the
a member of the development team or post to the Sourceforge Forums.

If you wish to contribute code to XRMS, you should be working from
the most current code possible.  In the case of bug fixes, this may
save you some work (someone else may have fixed it already), and in the
case of enhancements or other more complex patches, it will save work
for the developers by making very clear what has changed. For large,
sweeping changes, you probably want to discuss your proposed change on
the Sourceforge Forums, so that the development team and the XRMS user
community can comment on your proposed changes.

If you want to integrate third party software to XRMS, you should probably
familiarize yourself with the Plugin architecture, as that is what plugins
are for.  If you find yourself needing more plugin hooks as you develop your
plugin, let the development team know by posting to the Plugins
Forum on Sourceforge.  Somebody there will be happy to help you.

Start with a clean checkout from CVS or with a release tarball or snapshot.
The rest of these instructions will assume that you are worknig from a
snapshot tarball, which uncompresses to a directory called xrms.devel.
Change as required for your installation.

Update your installation from CVS using the following command from the
directory above your working directory:

cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@cvs.sf.net:/cvsroot/xrms update xrms.devel/

You will see cvs 'P' - Patch, 'U' Update, and possibly 'M' Merge your files
(vars.php and include-locations.inc will most likely 'M' merge)

Make the changes you need to this code.  Make a 'clean' copy of the files
you intend to modify, you'll need it later for creating the patch.

Do frequent CVS updates.
We recommend doing a CVS update before each development session.
This makes life easier for everybody.
Always do a CVS update immediately before submitting patch files, and
resolve any conflicts.

Once you've made your changes and are happy with the result, create a
patch file for each file you changed using the following command:

diff -u3 origfile changedfile >> filename.patch

the -u3 parameter to diff is very important, because it creates a 'unified'
diff with several lines of context.  This allows the patch program to find
where to insert the changed lines, even if the file has changed slightly
since the patch was generated.

Post your patch with a description of the changes to the Sourceforge
Patches Forum.  One of the XRMS developers will review it and commit your
changes to CVS.  Thanks for your interest in contributing to XRMS!

========================
HINTS

Installation on Windows

While editing the above mentioned php files you will have
to change the path name to XRMS.
Please enter the path name with slashes "/" (NOT
backslashes "\", as commonly used in windows),
e.g. "C:/Program Files/Apache
Group/Apache/htdocs/xrms"

Preventing some common errors
To prevent getting too many php warning messages you
might want to modify your php.ini as follows:
; - Show all errors, except for notices
error_reporting = E_ALL & ~E_NOTICE

If you get errors like "Warning: Cannot modify header
information -.. " the set the following option in your php.ini:
output_buffering = On

=======
HINTS, daily reports

To have daily reports emailed, put one or more of the following lines into
the crontab of your web server (adjust paths as nessecary):
