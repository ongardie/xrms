/**
 * Browse to the next Activity in the list
 *
 * This script can be reached through two different ways.
 * The first is by using the browse-sidebar.php file and clicking on an activity type.
 * The second is by using the save and next button on an activity.
 * In either case, we generate a session list of activity types and activity IDs
 * The activity list is ordered by: expired activities, activities with probabilities, activities ending first
 * We traverse the activities until there are none left. If we skip ahead, the list gets reordered.
 * When there are none left, it drops to the next activity type. When there are none left, it returns to the activities main page.
 *
 * @params int $activity_type_id or $activity_id
