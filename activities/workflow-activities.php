 * @todo To extend and internationalize activity template substitution,
 *       we would need to add a table to the database that would hold
 *       the substitution string and the sql to execute to return
 *       a single field to substitute.
 *       Then, this page would retrieve the result set for string/sql pairs, and
 *       run through the result set and do a test/select/substitute for each member
 *       the substitution result set.
