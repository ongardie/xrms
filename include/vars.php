/**
 *  Database Connection info for XRMS system
 *
 *  Beth Macknik (maulani) has created a nice, pretty web-based way
 *  to install XRMS.
 *
 *  You need to create a database, add a user, and grant permissions.
 *  @example:  from a mysql prompt
 *  create database xrms;
 *  grant all privileges on xrms.* to xrms@localhost identified by 'yourpasswordhere';
 *
 *  After you've created the database and database user,
 *  follow the instructions in the install/INSTALL file
 *  and on the screen in the install scripts.
