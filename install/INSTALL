INSTALLATION
============

To install XRMS, you need to place the main installation directory in a
location where your web server can access it.  For greater security, you
can move the include directory to another location that is not accessible
by your web server.

You must also have access to a mySQL database for your data.
(Support for other databases are planned in the future, but
mySQL is required for now.)

Create a MySQL database to hold the XRMS tables, and pick a valid MySQL
account for XRMS to use.

Example:
   from a mysql prompt
   create database xrms;
   grant all privileges on xrms.* to xrms@localhost identified by 'yourpasswordhere';

The include_locations.inc file is located at the top level of your
XRMS directory.  This file records where the include folder is located.
You should open this file with a text editor and follow
the instructions in the file.

The vars.php file is located within the include folder.
It contains all of the implementation specific variables such as database
location and password.  Edit this file to set these items.

Now, to setup the database schema and basic dataset, point your web browser to:

http://www.yourserver.com/path_to_xrms/install/install.php

The install code will do some basic checks on your include_locations.inc and
vars.php files.  It will then verify that it can communicate with the database.
If everything is good, it will connect to the database and setup the appropriate
schema and basic dataset.

If no errors are detected, it will then ask if you wish to create some sample data.
This is optional, and you can move directly to using xrms if you wish.

Please note that all of the installation code is non-destructive.
If you mistakenly run this over a live database, your data will not be harmed.



UPDATE
======

To update XRMS from a previous version, point your web browser to:

http://www.yourserver.com/path_to_xrms/install/update.php

This is a non-destructive routine to bring your database up to date.
(If you were up to date (CVS) as of 3/17/04 or later.)
