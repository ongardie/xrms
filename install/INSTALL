INSTALLATION
============

To install XRMS, you need to place the main installation directory in a
location where your web server can access it.  For greater security, you
may move the include directory to another location that is not accessible
by your web server.

You must also have access to a database for your data.  We believe that
XRMS has reasonable support for any database supported by an ADOdb
driver, as described in the README.  MySQL and MS SQL Server are probably
the most completely tested and reported on by the XRMS community.
The rest of this section will assume MySQL.  Please let the development
team know about your success or problems on other databases.

Create a MySQL database to hold the XRMS tables, and pick a valid MySQL
account for XRMS to use.

Example:
   from a mysql prompt
   create database xrms;
   grant all privileges on xrms.* to xrms@localhost identified by 'yourpasswordhere';

The include-locations.inc file is located at the top level of your
XRMS directory.  This file records where the include folder is located.
You should open this file with a text editor and follow
the instructions in the file.

The vars.php file is located within the include folder.
It contains all of the implementation specific variables such as database
location and password.  Edit this file to set these items.

After setting your vars.php variables, you will need to make certain that the
temporary directory, file storage directory, and export directories are all
writable by the web server.  These are the directories defined by the vars.php
variables: $tmp_upload_directory, $file_storage_directory, $tmp_export_directory

Now, to setup the database schema and basic dataset, point your web browser to:

http://www.yourserver.com/path_to_xrms/install/install.php

The install code will do some basic checks on your include_locations.inc and
vars.php files.  It will then verify that it can communicate with the database.
If everything is good, it will connect to the database and setup the appropriate
schema and basic dataset.

Once you've run the install script, it is recommended that you run the
Administration -> Database Structure Update
Administration -> Data Cleanup
to avoid possible errors when using features.

If you wish to have a more secure installation, you should consider changing the
xrms database user to have only SELECT, INSERT and UPDATE privileges.  If you want to
continue to use the upgrade scripts without problems, you will also need ALTER TABLE
privileges.  The xrms database user should not need DROP or DELETE privileges, as
these SQL commands are not used in the XRMS code.

If no errors are detected, it will then ask if you wish to create some sample data.
This is optional, and you can move directly to using xrms if you wish.

Please note that all of the installation code is non-destructive.
If you mistakenly run this over a live database, your data will not be harmed.


UPDATE/UPGRADE
==============

To update/upgrade XRMS from a previous version:

Here is the process, in a nutshell.

- make a copy of your vars.php and include-locations.inc files so that
you can preserve your settings

- untar the new distribution

- merge your include-locations.inc and vars.php file with the vars.php
file in the new release tarball.  The new release has additional options
that you will need for full functionality.

- log in as an administrative user

- run the 'Database Structure Update' and 'Data Cleanup' scripts from
the 'Administration' menu, just to be sure.

That should be it.  The developers have worked pretty hard to make sure
that upgrades go smoothly, because we are all running current CVS in
production at our current companies.  If we didn't automate this, our
installations would break as well.

This is a non-destructive routine to bring your system up to date.
(If you were up to date (CVS) as of 2004-03-17 or later.) If you are
starting from code older than the March date above, contact the
development team for assistance, as the process is more complicated.

=================
TEMP FILE CLEANUP

XRMS creates temporary files for exports, places imports in a directory, etc.

We recommend that you implement an automated directory
cleaning application like tmpwatch.
Managing temporary files is a facility best left
to routine system administration, not XRMS directly.

Most distributions come with some temp-file cleanup utility.
 (tmpwatch is distributed with Red Hat, Mandrake, and many
others)  Usually, this temporary file cleanup utility runs
on a daily basis, and cleans out old files.

For tmpwatch, you would add the following lines to your
/etc/cron.daily/tmpwatch script under linux
(adjust paths as needed)

/usr/sbin/tmpwatch -f 48 /var/www/html/xrms/export/
/usr/sbin/tmpwatch -f 48 /var/www/html/xrms/upload/

The lines above will delete any files that have not been
accessed in 48 hours from the export and upload directories.
(24 hours would have been a fine number as well)


========================
IMPORTING YOUR DATA

To import companies, export a .csv file of companies and contacts.
We've included templates for many common CRM/SFA applications, such as
Microsoft Outlook, Act!, SalesForce.com, Goldmine, Intuit Quickbooks,
and a 'default' import template.

Then visit Administration -> Import Companies/Contacts, select the appropriate
default values, and upload the file.  You will be able to preview the upload before
you actually commit to loading everything into the database.

We've tried to make the import 'safe'.
The import scripts run multiple checks on each record and attempts to not overwrite
existing data, or create duplicate records.  We make broad allowances for missing
data fields: as long as you have a Company Name (and a City for addresses),
things should work.

The default template includes the following fields:
    //company info
    company_name
    legal_name
    division_name
    website
    tax_id
    extref1
    extref2
    extref3
    company_custom1
    company_custom2
    company_custom3
    company_custom4
    employees
    revenue
    credit_limit
    terms
    company_profile
    company_code
    phone
    phone2
    fax

    //contact info
    first_names
    last_name
    email
    work_phone
    home_phone
    fax
    division
    salutation
    date_of_birth
    summary
    title
    description
    cell_phone
    aol
    yahoo
    msn
    interests
    contact_custom1
    contact_custom2
    contact_custom3
    contact_custom4
    contact_profile
    gender

    //address info
    address_name
    line1
    line2
    city
    state
    postal_code
    country
    address_body
    use_pretty_address

If you wish to use the default template, name the columns in your .csv
file as the columns are named above.  Don't worry if your file doesn't
have all the columns, or if the columns are in a different order.
The import routine uses the column names to determine which fields to
map things to, but it doesn't assume 'perfect data'.  Company name
is required.  If you want to import an address, City is required.
All other data will be handled safely if it is missing (we think).

You may also create your own templates, and submit them for
inclusion with XRMS.

If you create an import template for a third party CRM or contact
management application, or if you need help creating a template,
please contact the development team so that we may assist you and
so that we may include the new template in the next release.


=================
MISC

max_execution_time
PHP ships by default with max_execution_time of 30 seconds.  While this
should be enough time for most scripts in XRMS, the database installation
may take longer.  Several users have reported success by temporarily
raising the max_execution_time parameter in php.ini and restarting the
web server.  The exact time needed for database installation will vary,
but you may wish to set a high number for the installation, and then
settle back to a more reasonable 30 or 60 seconds. Some PHP installations
will display an error on the screen that max_execution_time has been
exceeded,while other PHP installs may fail silently or log to the
webserver logs.Post-install symptoms that this problem may have affected
you are errors about missing tables on your first login to XRMS.
If this happens to you, drop all tables, raise max_execution_time in
php.ini, restart the webserver, and run the installation script again.

If you suspect that php is not running correctly on your server,
try pointing your web browser at install/phpinfo.php. It should produce
several pages of information about your php installation.
